## Introduction
Maxcape was a project built to help [Runescape](https://www.runescape.com/community) players track their individual skills from the game. It was written in PHP using [Phalcon](https://phalcon.io/en-us) 3. The official site is [Maxcape.com](https://maxcape.com). We've wanted to make the website open source for a while and give back to the community.

## Features
- Individual skill tracking
- Max/Comp cape designer
- Dynamic forum signatures
- User profiles
- Administration Panel
- News System

## Notes
- The source code was originally written in 2017 and received very few updates apart from rewrites and bug fixes.
- The table structures used were questionable to an extent.
- The database schema has been excluded. 

## Contributing
We encourage anyone that's interested in supporting the project to submit features, bug fixes and or security fixes as a pull request.
